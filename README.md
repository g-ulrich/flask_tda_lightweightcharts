# Flask-TDA-LightweightCharts

## Overview

Flask-TDA-LightweightCharts is a Python Flask application delivering a ReactJS frontend for interacting with the TD Ameritrade API. Please be aware that, as of December 5, 2023, the TD Ameritrade API is currently in the process of being deprecated and might be moved to Schwab.

## Development

### Running Locally

- Flask Server: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- ReactJS Client: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Development Script

Use the `dev-script.js` file for development. It concurrently loads the Flask server, ReactJS client server, and runs the `npx tailwindcss watch` command.

```bash
node dev-script.js
```
## Abandonment Notice

**Important:** This project is being abandoned and is provided as-is. It may be useful for someone in need of a poorly written boilerplate Flask/React project.
